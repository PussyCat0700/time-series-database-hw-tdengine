 Aiming to get a clear insight into data model, database creation, time series insertion and query, I have divided my code reports into four sections as follos. It is recommended that you read them one after another to gain a coherent reading experience.

1. Data Model Construction: [data_model.md](data_model.md)
1. DBEngine Installation And Enviornments: [install_dbengine.md](install_dbengine.md)
1. Database Creation: [create_db.md](create_db.md)
1. Time series data insertion: [insert_data.md](insert_data.md)
1. Time series data query example: [query_db.md](query_db.md)
